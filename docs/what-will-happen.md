**What will happen?**

Running the `default` task will add or replace the `.eslintrc.json` file in the current working directory with a template from one of the following locations, in order of precedence:

- defined by you, stored at `~/templates/_eslintrc.json` (user home on your system), or if not defined
- the generic template in this project's [templates](templates) directory.
